                these Terms.
                These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any

                terms then you may not access the Service.</p>


            <p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites</strong></p>

            <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or

                YOMYPACKAGE.</p>

            <p>YOMYPACKAGE has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy

            <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>

            <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
                for any
                reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

            <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive

                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
                limitations of

            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Tennessee, United
                States, without
                regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                those rights.
                If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
                provisions
                of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
                regarding our
                Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the
                Service.</p>

            <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
                revision is
                material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
                What
                constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

            <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to
                be bound by
                the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
